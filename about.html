            <p id="aboutMe">Hey! I'm Tristan, I'm currently doing the Computer Systems Technician - Network and Cloud Technologies program at Niagara College. My interest in computers started when I was really young and got my own computer for the first time. I spent a lot of time on my computer, upgrading it and playing games on it. I've picked up coding recently but I started to wanted to code, watching people on Youtube code and thinking, 'I could do that'. In early 2024 I gained an interest in Linux since I was having still-ongoing issues with Windows, and I made the switch for a majority of this year to Linux. However, I since have moved back to Windows in October due to school and playing games with my friends.</p>
